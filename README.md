# PRK CTRL - Visitor Parking Management
Up to now, most of the condo buildings are using an “old fashioned” way to handle visitor parking - placing a physical pass onto the dashboard. Residents need to meet the visitor downstairs when they arrive, and go down when they leave so as to take back the pass.

This web application allow residents to reserve parking spot for their visitors, and when they come to visit they can use QR code to check in and check out.
More importantly, property managers can keep track of what vehicles there are and for how long, this is for security purposes and in case they have violated any bylaws.
